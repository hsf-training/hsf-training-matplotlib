# Introduction

A library of "vanilla" matplotlib functions to plot the most common HEP plots. The aim is to follow the main mindset of matplotlib documentation: being example-based. The difference being that it's specifically for HEP and gets you a nice plot without spending too much time tweaking the style. Often the approaches with "magically" good looking plots using some kind of library are hard to tweak or adapt and notoriously only work well for some examples. In this sense, example galleries are GREAT.
